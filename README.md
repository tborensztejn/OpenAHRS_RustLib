# OpenAHRS_RustLib

# What is an AHRS?
An AHRS (Attitude and Heading Reference System) is a system used to determine and track the orientation of an object relative to a fixed reference frame. It is crucial in various fields such as aerospace, robotics, and navigation. AHRS typically use sensors like gyroscopes, accelerometers, and magnetometers to provide accurate and reliable measurements under all conditions.

# Overview
OpenAHRS is a Rust library dedicated to AHRS algorithms, offering a comprehensive range of features for quaternion manipulation, matrix and vector operations, and processing raw sensor data. Whether you are looking to perform complex quaternion manipulations or integrate robust sensor fusion and filtering algorithms into your projects, OpenAHRS is the ideal solution.

OpenAHRS is designed to be reliable, optimized, versatile, educational, and performant. Its unique structure ensures unparalleled maintainability. All code lines are commented, and algorithms are sourced. You will find technical and scientific references for each one.

# Why This Project?
This field is highly complex (abstract theoretical foundations and complex mathematics) and is among the most active in technological research. In the industry, it is a highly competitive field, though not widely known, as it partly contributes to guidance systems (rockets, airplanes, missiles, satellites, etc.). There are very few open-source projects on this subject with a genuine desire to share domain knowledge, even fewer in the Francophone world. This project contributes to the democratization of knowledge and offers a valuable resource for those interested in this complex, vital, and under-recognized field.
