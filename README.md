I'm Titouan BORENSZTEJN (french mechatronic engineer). You can contact me for any information about this project at <borensztejn.titouan@gmail.com> or <openrtvc@gmail.com>

# Resources
All the scientific and technical documentation and other resources are available with the project. However, some errors are hidden in the documents, often due to a lack of proofreading. The errors I have found are corrected in the PDF files. If you find any others, please share them. Thank you for your contribution.

# Acknowledgments
Special thanks to the open-source community and contributors for their valuable contributions. This code has been developed in partnership with the French company FBO (Forges de Belles Ondes at <http://www.snfbo.com/>) and gives them the right to commercially exploit the software, but they must make any changes made to this part of the code public.
